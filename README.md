# THE MEALS

A simple mobile app using React Native. The application is a small cookbook. The ingredients are divided into categories and each recipe can belong to several categories. Each recipe can be marked as a favorite. Then it will be displayed on the favorites tab, which can be selected at the bottom of the screen.

The application has no backend and the data is stored in a file. You can also select filters (stored in Redux). To go to the page with filters use sidedrawer.
